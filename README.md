# Fundamentals of Software Architecture

I attended this course in `August - October 2023` and coded in a group with 2 other students. We learned about architecture with respect to pros and cons coupled with quality attributes such as **Performance**, **Availability** and **Reliability** and studied different architectural approaches. The high-level architecture and the technical management of data in [Distributed Systems](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-2/3.%20Distributed%20Systems?ref_type=heads) are directly attributable to the insights we gained in this course. It's also worth noting that many of the concepts covered in this course is related to my experiences in [Requirements & User Experience](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/4.%20Requirements%20&%20User%20Experience?ref_type=heads) and [Software Analysis Construction](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1/8.%20Software%20Analysis%20Construction?ref_type=heads)
